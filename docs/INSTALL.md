# snapMULTI — Complete Installation Guide

🇬🇧 **English** | 🇮🇹 [Italiano](INSTALL.it.md)

This guide takes you from a blank SD card to a working multiroom audio system, step by step.

---

## Fast path

Already comfortable with Raspberry Pi Imager and terminals? This is the whole install in one pass:

1. Flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** with Raspberry Pi Imager.
2. In Imager settings, set hostname, username/password, WiFi country/network, and enable SSH.
3. When the write finishes, remove and re-insert the SD so the `bootfs` partition mounts.
4. Download the latest snapMULTI release ZIP or `git clone https://github.com/lollonet/snapMULTI.git`.
5. From the snapMULTI folder, run `./scripts/prepare-sd.sh` on macOS/Linux or `.\scripts\prepare-sd.ps1` on Windows.
6. Choose what this Pi should do: **Audio Player**, **Music Server**, or **Server + Player**.
7. Eject the SD, boot the Pi, and wait roughly 15-20 minutes on a Pi 4/5 (longer on Pi 3 or Pi Zero 2 W). It installs, verifies, then reboots once. The HDMI progress display surfaces the expected total time alongside elapsed so you know how far along you are.
8. Open `http://<hostname>.local:8083/` — the start page links to Snapweb, myMPD, status, and API endpoints.

If any step is unclear, continue with the detailed walkthrough below. If first boot fails, recover the diagnostic bundle from the SD card as described in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md — When in doubt](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#when-in-doubt--grab-the-diagnostic-bundle).

## What you need

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 (2 GB+ RAM) | Pi 4 is the best launch target; Pi 5 and Pi 3B+ are usable but have a thinner validation matrix |
| microSD card (16 GB+) | Class 10 / A1 or better. 32 GB recommended |
| Power supply | Official 15W USB-C for Pi 4 |
| A second computer | macOS, Linux, or Windows — to prepare the SD card |
| Network connection | Ethernet (recommended) or WiFi |
| Audio output | Validated HiFiBerry/InnoMaker I2S HAT, HiFiBerry Digi+, or HDMI/onboard fallback |

For a speaker Pi (Audio Player mode): same as above plus a way to connect speakers. For first installs, stay inside the [validated hardware matrix](HARDWARE.md#hardware-support-policy).

---

## Before you start: turn the speakers on

snapMULTI tells you it's alive through audio. During install you'll hear a 1-second confirmation tone after the audio hardware is detected; if the amplifier or speakers are off or muted, you'll never know it worked until you try to play music 10 minutes later.

Before starting the install:

- Power on the amplifier or active speakers
- Set the volume to a **moderate level** — snapMULTI also plays a short health-check tone at every boot/reboot, not just at install; keep the volume comfortable for a sound that fires unattended (e.g. after a power cut at night)
- Confirm cables are connected from the DAC output to the amplifier input
- If headphones are plugged into the Pi's 3.5 mm jack, audio will route there instead of the HAT — unplug them if you want HAT output

You can opt out of the install-time tone by setting `TEST_TONE=false` in `install.conf` on the SD card's boot partition (`snapmulti/install.conf` — created by `prepare-sd.sh`), but the recommended path for a first install is: keep the speakers on, hear the tone, know your audio chain is correct from minute one.

---

## Step 1 — Flash the SD card

Use **[Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)** (free download for macOS, Windows, Linux).

### 1a. Choose the OS

1. Open Raspberry Pi Imager
2. Click **Choose Device** → select **Raspberry Pi 4** (or your model)
3. Click **Choose OS** → scroll to **Raspberry Pi OS (other)** → select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**

> **Why Lite?** snapMULTI runs entirely in Docker. The desktop environment wastes RAM and storage. Use Lite.

> **Important: 64-bit is required.** Do not select the 32-bit version — snapMULTI Docker images are built for `arm64` only. This applies to all Pi models including Pi Zero 2 W (Imager may default to 32-bit for it — make sure to select 64-bit).

### 1b. Choose the SD card

Click **Choose Storage** → select your SD card.

> If you don't see your card: make sure it is inserted. On Windows, Imager only shows removable drives — it will not show fixed disks.

### 1c. Configure the OS (important)

Click **Next** → Imager asks **"Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?"** → click **Edit Settings**.

Fill in the **General** tab:

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|---------------|
| **Set hostname** | A name for this Pi — e.g. `pi-server` (server), `pi-display` (speaker) |
| **Set username and password** | Any username/password — you'll use these to SSH in |
| **Configure wireless LAN** | Your WiFi SSID, password, and **country** (required for 5 GHz bands) |
| **Set locale** | Your timezone and keyboard layout |

Switch to the **Services** tab:

- Check **Enable SSH**
- Select **Use password authentication**

Click **Save**, then **Yes** to apply the settings.

> **Tip:** If connecting via Ethernet, you can skip WiFi — the Pi will get an IP via DHCP automatically.

### 1d. Write the image

Click **Yes** to erase and write. This takes 3–8 minutes depending on your SD card speed.

When Imager shows "Write Successful" — **do not click the Eject button yet** (see next step).

---

## Step 2 — Re-insert the SD card

Imager may unmount the SD card after writing. You need it mounted to run the setup script.

**macOS:** Remove and re-insert the SD card. It appears in Finder as **bootfs**.

**Linux:** Remove and re-insert. It mounts automatically, usually at `/media/$USER/bootfs`. Check with:
```bash
lsblk -o NAME,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT | grep bootfs
```

**Windows:** Remove and re-insert. It appears in File Explorer as a small drive (~250 MB) labeled **bootfs** — typically `E:\` or `F:\`. Ignore the larger partition if two appear; only the small FAT32 one is needed.

---

## Step 3 — Get the snapMULTI files

Pick one of the two options. If you are not a developer, use **Option A — Download the ZIP**.

### Option A — Download the ZIP (no Git required)

1. Open [https://github.com/lollonet/snapMULTI/releases/latest](https://github.com/lollonet/snapMULTI/releases/latest) in your browser
2. Under **Assets**, click **Source code (zip)** to download the latest release
3. Extract the ZIP — you get a folder named `snapMULTI-<version>`. The folder name doesn't matter — `prepare-sd.sh` finds its project root via its own location
4. Keep the folder open — the next section shows how to open a terminal there

> Prefer the tagged release ZIP over the green **Code → Download ZIP** button on the repo home page — the latter ships the `main` branch, which may include unreleased work-in-progress.

### Option B — Clone with Git (recommended for updates)

You need Git installed on your computer.

**macOS** — Git comes with Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): `brew install git`

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

**Windows** — Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Accept all defaults during install. Then open **Git Bash** (not PowerShell) for the next steps, or use PowerShell with the commands below.

Then:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lollonet/snapMULTI.git
cd snapMULTI
```

> The repository includes both server and client software in a single monorepo.

### Open a terminal in the snapMULTI folder

You need the terminal only to run the SD preparation script.

| OS | Easiest way |
|----|-------------|
| macOS | Open the extracted folder in Finder, then drag the folder into a Terminal window after typing `cd ` |
| Windows | Open the extracted folder in File Explorer, right-click empty space, choose **Open in Terminal** |
| Linux | Open the folder in your file manager, right-click empty space, choose **Open in Terminal** |

You are in the right place if `ls scripts` (macOS/Linux) or `dir scripts` (Windows) shows `prepare-sd.sh` / `prepare-sd.ps1`.

---

## Step 4 — Prepare the SD card

Run the preparation script. It auto-detects your SD card and walks you through a short menu.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
./scripts/prepare-sd.sh
```

If auto-detection fails (multiple SD cards, unusual mount point):
```bash
./scripts/prepare-sd.sh /Volumes/bootfs        # macOS
./scripts/prepare-sd.sh /media/$USER/bootfs    # Linux
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell as your regular user (not Administrator). If you haven't run scripts before:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

Then:
```powershell
.\scripts\prepare-sd.ps1
```

If auto-detection fails:
```powershell
.\scripts\prepare-sd.ps1 -Boot E:\    # replace E: with your SD card's drive letter
```

### Menu 1 — What should this Pi do?

```
  +---------------------------------------------+
  |        snapMULTI -- SD Card Setup            |
  |                                              |
  |  What should this Pi do?                     |
  |                                              |
  |  1) Audio Player                             |
  |     Play music from your server on speakers  |
  |                                              |
  |  2) Music Server                             |
  |     Central hub for Spotify, AirPlay, etc.   |
  |                                              |
  |  3) Server + Player                          |
  |     Both server and local speaker output     |
  |                                              |
  +---------------------------------------------+
```

| Option | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| **1 — Audio Player** | This Pi will be a speaker only. Streams audio from a snapMULTI server elsewhere on your network |
| **2 — Music Server** | Central hub. Hosts Spotify Connect, AirPlay, Tidal, MPD. No local speaker output |
| **3 — Server + Player** | One Pi does everything — server and local speaker. **Choose this if you only have one Pi** and want to play music on it directly |

> **Pi Zero 2 W users:** the installer behaves differently because the board has only 512 MB RAM:
> - **Choice 1 (Audio Player)** — works, but the profile is auto-promoted to `client-native`: native snapclient `.deb`, no Docker, no cover-art display, single-client role only. The full Docker stack does not fit
> - **Choices 2 and 3** — the first boot aborts with `Pi Zero 2W (512 MB RAM) cannot host the snapMULTI server stack` and stops. The server needs at least a Pi 3 B+ with 1 GB RAM. Reflash the SD card with choice 1, or use a different Pi
>
> See [HARDWARE.md — Pi Zero 2 W Notes](HARDWARE.md#pi-zero-2-w-notes) for the full constraint list.

### Menu 2 — Audio output *(Audio Player and Server+Player only)*

```
  +---------------------------------------------+
  |        Audio output                          |
  |                                              |
  |  1) Auto-detect (recommended)                |
  |     Detects HAT via EEPROM/I2C, falls back   |
  |     to USB DAC or built-in audio             |
  |                                              |
  |  2) I have an audio HAT (choose from list)   |
  |                                              |
  |  3) No HAT -- use Pi built-in audio          |
  |     HDMI (TV/monitor) or 3.5mm jack          |
  |                                              |
  +---------------------------------------------+
```

| Option | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| **1 — Auto-detect** | Best first choice when you are using launch-validated HiFiBerry/InnoMaker hardware. The Pi probes the HAT EEPROM at first boot, scans the I2C bus for known DAC chips, falls back to USB DAC, then to built-in audio |
| **2 — I have an audio HAT** | Skip auto-detect and pick a profile from the compatibility list. Useful when your HAT lacks an EEPROM or the chip is shared across profiles. Entries outside the validated matrix are experimental/manual, not a support promise |
| **3 — No HAT — built-in audio** | Pi 3/4/5 onboard audio. You then pick between HDMI (TV/monitor) or 3.5mm jack. **Pi 5 has no analog jack** — pick HDMI or let auto-detect handle it |

> For launch stability, prefer the hardware listed as **Validated** in [HARDWARE.md — Hardware support policy](HARDWARE.md#hardware-support-policy). USB DACs and many HAT profiles may work, but they are not all physically validated by the project yet.

If you pick **3**, a sub-menu asks for the output:
- **HDMI** — works on Pi 3, Pi 4, Pi 5. The real ALSA card name (`vc4-hdmi-0`, `HDMI`, depending on kernel) is resolved at first boot via `aplay -L`
- **3.5mm jack (Headphones)** — works on Pi 3 and Pi 4 only. Pi 5 has no analog jack; if you pick this on Pi 5, the installer logs a warning and automatically falls back to HDMI

---

### Menu 3 — Where is your music? *(Music Server and Server+Player only)*

```
  +---------------------------------------------+
  |        Where is your music?                  |
  |                                              |
  |  1) Streaming only                           |
  |     Spotify, AirPlay, Tidal (no local files) |
  |                                              |
  |  2) USB drive                                |
  |     Plug in before powering on the Pi        |
  |                                              |
  |  3) Network share (NFS/SMB)                  |
  |     Music on a NAS or another computer       |
  |                                              |
  |  4) I'll set it up later                     |
  |     Mount music dir manually after install   |
  |                                              |
  +---------------------------------------------+
```

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **1 — Streaming only** | No local music library. Spotify, AirPlay and Tidal work without any files |
| **2 — USB drive** | Plug your USB drive into the Pi *before* powering on. It auto-mounts |
| **3 — Network share** | You'll be asked for server hostname/IP and share path. NFS for Linux/Mac/NAS; SMB for Windows shares. Credentials are stored on the SD card temporarily and removed after first boot |
| **4 — Set up later** | Skips music config. Add your library to `/opt/snapmulti/.env` after install (see [ADVANCED.md — Music library on the network](ADVANCED.md#music-library-on-the-network)) |

> **First install?** Choose **1 — Streaming only** unless you already know your NAS protocol, hostname/IP, share name and credentials. You can add a NAS later after one clean boot.

If you choose **Network share**, you'll then enter:
- **NFS:** server hostname or IP (e.g. `nas.local`) and export path (e.g. `/volume1/music`)
- **SMB:** server hostname or IP, share name (e.g. `Music`), and optional username/password

---

### What the script does

After you answer the menus, `prepare-sd.sh` / `prepare-sd.ps1`:

1. Copies the installer and config files onto the boot partition
2. Patches the Pi's first-boot mechanism (`user-data` on Bookworm) to run the installer automatically
3. Sets a temporary 800×600 display resolution for the install progress screen
4. Verifies all files are present
5. Unmounts / ejects the SD card

You should see **"All checks passed."** and **"SD card ready!"** at the end.

---

## Step 5 — Boot the Pi

1. **Remove the SD card** from your computer
2. Insert it into the Pi
3. Connect power
4. **Wait ~15-20 minutes on a Pi 4/5** — longer on Pi 3 or Pi Zero 2 W. The Pi installs Docker, pulls images, starts all services, verifies them, then reboots once

### What you'll see on HDMI

If you have a monitor or TV connected, the Pi shows a text progress display:

```
snapMULTI Auto-Install
======================

[ ] Waiting for network...
[>] Installing Docker...          [=====>          ] 40%
[ ] Pulling images...
[ ] Starting services...
[ ] Verifying health...
```

The Pi **reboots automatically** when installation is complete. After the reboot, the display goes dark (normal — no desktop on Lite OS).

> If the HDMI stays blank throughout: the installation is still running in the background — `firstboot.sh` is a systemd service that does not need a display. **The green ACT LED on the Pi will flash irregularly throughout the 15-20 min Pi 4/5 window — that's SD-card activity, your sign the install is making progress.** Wait the full window; to check progress without a screen, `ssh <username>@<hostname>.local` and run `sudo journalctl -u snapmulti-firstboot.service -f`.

### What you'll hear

Roughly 3–4 minutes into the install, after the audio hardware is detected, snapMULTI plays a single 1-second tone at 440 Hz (the "A" above middle C). This one tone confirms three things at once:

- The audio HAT was detected correctly
- The ALSA route to the speaker is configured
- Speaker and amplifier chain are powered and connected

If you don't hear it, the install still continues — but check power, volume, and cables before trying to play music later. To suppress the tone (overnight installs, speakers disconnected), set `TEST_TONE=false` in `install.conf` before first boot.

> After install, an optional `device-smoke.sh --tone` health check plays a distinctive cue per result (PASS / WARN / FAIL). See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md — Audible result cues](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#health-check-tones).
>
> **Heads up — auto-boot health cue is silent while audio plays.** snapMULTI fires a smoke check after every reboot. If any source is already streaming through Snapcast when the check runs (autoplay, MPD resume), the DAC is held exclusively by the player and the cue is suppressed by ALSA. The check itself still runs and you can read its result at `/status` or by running `device-smoke.sh --both --tone` manually when audio is paused.
>
> **First-boot FAIL with a large music library?** On the very first boot after a fresh install (or after a major library change), MPD scans the whole collection. On NFS/SMB libraries with many thousands of tracks this can take hours. During that window the auto-boot smoke may report FAIL because `mpd` is still in the `starting` healthcheck state. Open `http://<hostname>.local:8083/status` — if you see "MPD library scan in progress (#N)" in the Snapcast + MPD section, just let it finish. The next boot's tone will be PASS.

---

## Step 6 — Verify it works

> **Hostname placeholder.** From here on, `<hostname>.local` means the hostname you set in Imager at Step 1c. If you set `myradio`, use `myradio.local` everywhere `<hostname>.local` appears below.

### Beginner check — open the start page

From another computer or phone on the same network, open:

```
http://<hostname>.local:8083/
```

Open **Status** from that page. If every check is green, the platform is healthy. If the start page does not open, try the same URL with the Pi's IP address instead of `<hostname>.local`.

### Find the Pi on your network

From your computer, ping the Pi using its hostname:

```bash
ping <hostname>.local
```

If ping works, SSH in:

```bash
ssh <username>@<hostname>.local
```

> **Windows users:** Use Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or [PuTTY](https://putty.org) with `<hostname>.local` as the host.

> **If `.local` doesn't resolve:** Use the IP address instead. Find it in your router or mesh-WiFi app under connected devices / DHCP clients, or check the HDMI output after reboot — the Pi prints its IP on the console.

### Advanced check — running containers

```bash
sudo docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

**Music Server (option 2 or 3)** — expected output:
```
NAMES              STATUS
snapserver         Up X minutes (healthy)
shairport-sync     Up X minutes (healthy)
librespot          Up X minutes (healthy)
mpd                Up X minutes (healthy)
mympd              Up X minutes (healthy)
metadata           Up X minutes (healthy)
```
On Raspberry Pi (ARM — Pi 3 B+ / 4 / 5): `tidal-connect` also appears (enabled by default on ARM installs; remove `tidal` from `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `/opt/snapmulti/.env` to opt out).

**Audio Player (option 1)** — expected output:
```
NAMES              STATUS
snapclient         Up X minutes (healthy)
audio-visualizer   Up X minutes (healthy)
fb-display         Up X minutes (healthy)
```
`audio-visualizer` and `fb-display` only appear if an HDMI display was connected at first boot.

### Open the web interfaces (server only)

The main entry point is:

```
http://<hostname>.local:8083/
```

It links to all browser-facing snapMULTI pages.

For the music library, open:

```
http://<hostname>.local:8180
```

This is **myMPD** — browse your music library, build playlists, control playback.

The **Snapcast web UI** (control which speaker plays what) is at:

```
http://<hostname>.local:1780
```

If **Status** is green and the web interfaces load — your server is ready. Try playing a track from Snapweb (`http://<hostname>.local:1780`) or cast from Spotify/AirPlay to confirm audio works.

---

## Connecting music sources

| Source | What to do after install |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Spotify** | Open Spotify app → Devices → select **"`<hostname>` Spotify"** (Premium required) |
| **AirPlay** | iPhone/iPad/Mac → AirPlay icon → select **"`<hostname>` AirPlay"** |
| **Tidal** | Open Tidal app → Cast → select **"`<hostname>` Tidal"** (ARM/Pi only) |
| **Music library** | Open `http://<hostname>.local:8180` and browse your files |
| **Snapcast app** | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.badaix.snapcast) — connect to `<hostname>.local` |

---

## Next steps

| Goal | Where |
|------|-------|
| Add another speaker (multi-room), connect a NAS library, customise `.env`, manual deploy | [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md) |
| Something failed (first boot, post-install, mDNS, audio) | [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) |
| Hardware matrix, network requirements, Pi Zero 2 W details | [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md) |
| Architecture, audio sources, security model | [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) |

---

## What's installed where

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `/opt/snapmulti/` | Server: Docker Compose files, config, data |
| `/opt/snapclient/` | Client: Docker Compose files, audio config |
| `/opt/snapmulti/.env` | Server settings (edit to change config) |
| `/opt/snapclient/.env` | Client settings (edit to change config) |

To change settings after install:
```bash
sudo nano /opt/snapmulti/.env      # or /opt/snapclient/.env for speaker Pi
cd /opt/snapmulti
sudo docker compose up -d           # NOT restart — restart doesn't reload .env
```

---

## Network requirements

- The Pi and your phone/computer must be on the **same subnet** (same router) for mDNS (`.local` hostnames) and auto-discovery to work
- Most home networks work out of the box — no port forwarding or firewall changes needed
- For the full list of ports and firewall rules, see [Advanced Guide — Firewall rules](ADVANCED.md#firewall-rules)
- mDNS uses UDP 5353 — if you have multiple VLANs, you'll need an mDNS repeater or set static IPs in `.env`
