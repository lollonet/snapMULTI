# Architecture Reference

The "how it's put together" reference — services, ports, audio sources, security model, mDNS, systemd units. This file is **not a how-to**. For operational procedures (multi-room, NFS, custom `.env`, manual deploy, MPD CLI, JSON-RPC) see [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md). For first-time install see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). For failures see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). For hardware compatibility see [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md).

## Architecture

Server stack (7 containers, host networking):

| Container | Role | Port |
|-----------|------|------|
| `snapserver` | Audio streaming + JSON-RPC control | 1704, 1705, 1780, 4953 |
| `mpd` | Music library playback (FIFO out) | 6600, 8000 |
| `mympd` | Web UI for MPD | 8180 |
| `shairport-sync` | AirPlay receiver (FIFO out) | 5000, 5858 |
| `librespot` | Spotify Connect (FIFO out) | 24879 + ephemeral |
| `tidal-connect` | Tidal Connect, ARM only (FIFO out) | 2019 |
| `metadata` | Cover art + track info | 8082 (WS), 8083 (HTTP) |

Audio chain: source → FIFO pipe in `/audio/` → snapserver → FLAC over network → snapclient → ALSA out. Unified format `44100:16:2` (44.1 kHz / 16-bit / stereo) across all sources, no resampling.

Client stack (3 containers on Pi 3/4/5; native snapclient `.deb` on Pi Zero 2W):
`snapclient` + `audio-visualizer` (port 8081) + `fb-display` (HDMI cover art).

## Container security model

Defaults applied to every container in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `cap_drop` | `ALL` | Containers don't need root capabilities for audio routing |
| `read_only` | `true` + tmpfs at `/tmp` / `/run` | Compromised process can't write to image or persist code |
| `no-new-privileges` | `true` | Setuid binaries inside the container can't escalate |
| `user` | `PUID:PGID` (default `1000:1000`) | Non-root process inside the container |
| Resource limits | mem + CPU per service in `deploy.resources` | One runaway container can't starve the rest |

**Exception 1 — D-Bus / Avahi containers** (`snapserver`, `shairport-sync`, `librespot`): need `apparmor:unconfined` to access the host's D-Bus socket for mDNS advertisement (Avahi) and `cap_add: DAC_OVERRIDE` to write to the named-pipe FIFOs owned by the host's `PUID` user. AppArmor in the default Ubuntu profile blocks the D-Bus connection otherwise. `mpd` mounts the same Avahi/D-Bus sockets but keeps the default AppArmor profile — it does not require `apparmor:unconfined`. Everything else stays dropped.

**Exception 2 — `tidal-connect`** (ARM only): runs as root because the proprietary upstream binary needs it. The Compose profile is **opt-in** — `tidal-connect` only runs when you explicitly enable the `tidal` profile (see [Tidal Connect security note](#tidal-connect-security-note)).

**Threat model**: snapMULTI is designed for a trusted LAN — server and clients on the same subnet behind a residential router. Out-of-scope: WAN exposure (no authentication on JSON-RPC, Snapweb or myMPD), multi-tenant scenarios, malicious clients on the LAN. If you need any of those, put a reverse proxy with auth in front and use `bind 127.0.0.1` in `config/snapserver.conf`.

## Audio Sources

9 sources defined in `config/snapserver.conf` (5 active, 4 available as commented examples):

| # | Stream ID | Type | How to play |
|---|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `MPD` | pipe | myMPD web UI at `:8180`, or any MPD client (`mpc`, Cantata, MPDroid) on port `6600` |
| 2 | `Tidal` | pipe (ARM only) | Cast from the Tidal app — appears as `<hostname> Tidal` |
| 3 | `AirPlay` | pipe | Cast from iOS / macOS — appears as the server hostname |
| 4 | `Spotify` | pipe | Cast from any Spotify Premium app — appears as `<hostname> Spotify` |
| 5 | `TCP-Input` | tcp (server, :4953) | Stream raw PCM from anywhere: `ffmpeg ... tcp://<server>:4953` |
| 6 | `LineIn` | alsa | Capture from ALSA device. Uncomment in `snapserver.conf` |
| 7 | `AutoSwitch` | meta | Auto-failover across other streams. Uncomment in `snapserver.conf` |
| 8 | `Alert` | file | Play a fixed audio file on demand. Uncomment in `snapserver.conf` |
| 9 | `Remote` | tcp (client) | Pull from another TCP server. Uncomment in `snapserver.conf` |

Source-specific params (FIFO path, controlscript, sample format) live inline in `config/snapserver.conf` — that file is the authoritative reference.

### Customising device names

Spotify and Tidal default to `<hostname> Spotify` / `<hostname> Tidal`. Override via `SPOTIFY_NAME` / `TIDAL_NAME` in `.env` — see [ADVANCED.md — Custom config](ADVANCED.md#custom-config--env-files).

### Tidal Connect security note

<a id="tidal-connect-security-note"></a>
Tidal Connect is **opt-in** (enable the `tidal` Compose profile). The upstream container is built on Raspbian Stretch (EOL 2019), pulls packages from `archive.debian.org` with `trusted=yes`, and contains a proprietary unmaintained binary. ARM only (no x86_64 build exists). Read the disclosure block in `docker-compose.yml` before enabling.

### Streaming from Android (no native cast)

| Method | App | Quality | Setup |
|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| AirPlay sender | AirMusic, AllStream | Good | Install app → select AirPlay target = the server hostname |
| TCP via BubbleUPnP | BubbleUPnP + ffmpeg relay | Good | Capture in BubbleUPnP, relay `ffmpeg ... tcp://server:4953` |
| Direct TCP | Termux + ffmpeg | Lossless | `ffmpeg -f pulse -i default -f s16le -ar 44100 -ac 2 tcp://server:4953` |

## Control Interfaces

| Interface | URL | What it does |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **Snapweb** | `http://<server>:1780` | Switch sources per speaker, group/ungroup, per-room volume |
| **myMPD** | `http://<server>:8180` | Browse music library, queues, playlists, cover art |
| **System status** | `http://<server>:8083/status` | Container + audio + NFS health (auto-refresh) |
| **Snapcast Android app** | [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.badaix.snapcast) | Mobile equivalent of Snapweb |

Quick rules:
- Play music from library → myMPD
- Switch a speaker's source → Snapweb or the Android app
- Cast from Spotify/AirPlay/Tidal → the source app picks the speaker
- Health check → `/status` page

Power-user commands (MPD CLI, JSON-RPC source switching, custom `.env`): [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md).

## Autodiscovery (mDNS)

Snapcast, AirPlay, Spotify and Tidal advertise themselves on the LAN via the **host's** `avahi-daemon` (D-Bus socket bind-mounted into the relevant containers). Required at the host: `systemctl is-active avahi-daemon` returns `active`. **Do not run avahi-daemon inside containers** — port 5353 conflicts with the host.

Snapcast 0.35.x quits its Avahi poll loop on `AVAHI_CLIENT_FAILURE` with no retry. The systemd units include `PartOf=avahi-daemon.service` so a host avahi restart recreates the Compose stacks automatically (~3 s audio gap).

Quick verify:

```bash
avahi-browse -r _snapcast._tcp --terminate
avahi-browse -r _raop._tcp --terminate
ss -tlnp | grep -E '1704|1705|1780'
```

When discovery fails (Spotify / AirPlay / Tidal not visible, speakers missing in Snapweb): [TROUBLESHOOTING.md — mDNS discovery](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#mdns-discovery).

## Systemd Units

systemd owns container lifecycle after install (ADR-005). Docker `restart: unless-stopped` handles crashes, systemd handles boot.

- Server: `snapmulti-server.service`, `snapmulti-status.timer`, `snapmulti-backup.timer`
- Client: `snapclient.service`, `snapclient-discover.timer`, `snapclient-display.service` (HDMI clients only)
- All: `snapmulti-boot-tune.service`

Inspect with `systemctl cat <unit>`. Deployment paths and update strategy: [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md#deployment-without-prepare-sd).

## Logs & Diagnostics

```bash
# server live logs
cd /opt/snapmulti && docker compose logs -f
docker compose logs -f snapserver shairport-sync librespot mpd

# container health
docker compose ps
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' snapserver

# system status page (browser)
http://<server>:8083/status
```
