# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Documentation: Audio format & network mode** — Explains 44100:16:2 sample rate, FLAC codec, and why host networking is required for mDNS
- **Documentation: Troubleshooting guide** — Common issues table in README with solutions for Spotify/AirPlay visibility, audio sync, and connection problems
- **Documentation: Logs & diagnostics** — Container logs, common error messages, health checks, and installation log location
- **Documentation: Upgrade instructions** — Standard update, backup, and rollback procedures

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — Updated project structure to reflect current state (scripts/, tidal, workflows, service counts)
- **CI/CD: validate.yml** — Added shellcheck linting for all scripts/ with `-S warning` severity
- **Service naming** — AirPlay and Spotify use hostname-based names with optional `AIRPLAY_NAME`/`SPOTIFY_NAME` env vars for customization
- **deploy.sh validation** — Config file validation, PROJECT_ROOT check, and `--profile` argument validation with safe `shift` handling
- **deploy.sh service verification** — Retry loop (6 attempts x 10s) instead of fixed sleep for slow-starting services
- **firstboot.sh container verification** — Healthcheck-based loop (12 attempts x 10s) replaces naive `sleep 5` + container count
- **firstboot.sh network check** — Detects default gateway each iteration, falls back to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8 (works behind restrictive firewalls)

### Fixed
- **prepare-sd.sh** — Support Bookworm cloud-init user-data and rpi-snapclient-usb boot pattern
- **firstboot.sh directory structure** — Create `scripts/` subdirectory expected by deploy.sh
- **firstboot.sh healthcheck grep** — Fix `(unhealthy)` containers being counted as healthy due to substring match

### Security
- **DEVICE_NAME sanitization** — Entrypoint script strips shell metacharacters to prevent command injection ([#40](https://github.com/lollonet/snapMULTI/pull/40))
- **FIFO permissions** — Changed from 666 (world-writable) to 660 (owner+group only)
- **PATH hardening** — Secure PATH export in firstboot.sh prevents hijacking
- **Docker install** — Uses official APT repository with GPG verification instead of `curl | sh`

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-04

Initial release. Multiroom audio server with five audio sources, security hardening, hardware auto-detection, and zero-touch deployment.

### Fixed

- **Zero-touch boot freeze** — Fixed prepare-sd.sh overwriting Pi Imager's firstrun.sh, which broke WiFi configuration and caused boot to hang at "Waiting for network..."

### Features

- **Multiroom audio** — Snapcast server with synchronized playback across all clients
- **Five audio sources**:
  - MPD (local music library)
  - AirPlay (via shairport-sync)
  - Spotify Connect (via librespot)
  - TCP input (port 4953 for external streams)
  - Tidal streaming (via tidalapi, HiFi subscription required)
- **myMPD web GUI** — Mobile-ready interface on port 8180
- **mDNS autodiscovery** — Automatic client discovery via Avahi/Bonjour
- **Security hardening** — read_only containers, no-new-privileges, cap_drop ALL, tmpfs mounts
- **Hardware auto-detection** — Auto-selects resource profile (minimal/standard/performance) based on RAM and Pi model
- **Zero-touch SD preparation** — `scripts/prepare-sd.sh` for automatic first-boot installation
- **Deploy script** — `scripts/deploy.sh` bootstraps fresh Linux machines
- **Multi-arch images** — amd64 + arm64 on ghcr.io
- **Bilingual docs** — English + Italian

### Technical

- Audio format: 44100:16:2 (CD quality)
- Container architecture: 5 separate services communicating via named pipes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners
- Resource profiles: minimal (Pi Zero 2/Pi 3), standard (Pi 4 2GB), performance (Pi 4 4GB+/Pi 5)
