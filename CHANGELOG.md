## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-04

Initial release. Multiroom audio server with five audio sources, security hardening, hardware auto-detection, and zero-touch deployment.

### Fixed

- **Zero-touch boot freeze** — Fixed prepare-sd.sh overwriting Pi Imager's firstrun.sh, which broke WiFi configuration and caused boot to hang at "Waiting for network..."

### Features

- **Five audio sources**:
  - MPD (local music library)
  - AirPlay (via shairport-sync)
  - Spotify Connect (via librespot)
  - TCP input (port 4953 for external streams)
  - Tidal streaming (via tidalapi, HiFi subscription required)
- **myMPD web GUI** — Mobile-ready interface on port 8180
- **mDNS autodiscovery** — Automatic client discovery via Avahi/Bonjour
- **Security hardening** — read_only containers, no-new-privileges, cap_drop ALL, tmpfs mounts
- **Hardware auto-detection** — Auto-selects resource profile (minimal/standard/performance) based on RAM and Pi model
- **Zero-touch SD preparation** — `scripts/prepare-sd.sh` for automatic first-boot installation
- **Deploy script** — `scripts/deploy.sh` bootstraps fresh Linux machines
- **Multi-arch images** — amd64 + arm64 on ghcr.io
- **Bilingual docs** — English + Italian

### Technical

- Audio format: 44100:16:2 (CD quality)
- Container architecture: 5 separate services communicating via named pipes
